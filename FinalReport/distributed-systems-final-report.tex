\section{Concept}\label{concept}
This project aims to develop a web-based game application for playing Liar's Poker, a fun and engaging card game centered around deception and bluffing. Inspired by traditional poker, Liar's Poker is played with a standard deck of cards and is suitable for two or more players. Our application will provide an online platform where users can enjoy the game with others in real-time, no matter where they are.

\subsection{Game Rules}\label{game-rules}
Liar's Poker is a game of deception and bluffing that is played with a standard deck of cards without any joker. Each player starts with one card. A round starts with someone naming a poker combination. With the turn rotating clockwise, each next player has a choice:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Rise the stakes}\par
  name a higher poker combination than the one named by the previous player that they belive is present in the combined cards of all players.
  \item \textbf{Call bullsh*t} \par
  the player calls bullsh*t on the previous player's combination if the player think the previous player is bluffing or mistaken.
\end{itemize}
When someone calls bullsh*t, all players reveal their cards and the presence of the contested poker hand is verified. If the hand is present, the player who called bullsh*t loses the round; else, the player who named this poker hand loses the round.\par\noindent
The loser starts all subsequent rounds with one extra card, and names the first combination in the next round.\par\noindent
if someone loses when they have 5 cards, they are kicked from the game.
The last person remaining in the game is the winner.

\subsection{Questions and Answers}\label{questions-and-answers}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Question:} \emph{How do users interact with the system?}\par
        \textbf{Answer:} Users can access the application through a web browser.
  \item \textbf{Question:} \emph{What happens if one player disconnect during the game?}\par
        \textbf{Answer:} The game will pause until the player reconnects. If the player does not reconnect within a certain time frame, they will be kicked from the game.
  \item \textbf{Question:} \emph{What happens if the server dies during the game?}\par
        \textbf{Answer:} The game goes on
  \item \textbf{Question:} \emph{Does the system need to store player's data?}\par
        \textbf{Answer:} The system doesn't need to store data, as the player does not need to create an account.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Usage Scenarios}\label{usage-scenarios}
This section describes the typical usage scenario of a group of friends playing Liar's Poker on our platform.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Name choice}\par
  The player chooses a unique nickname to use during the game.
  \item \textbf{Lobby creation}\par
  One user creates a new lobby and can decide to share the access code with friends or make the lobby public. 
  \item \textbf{Joining the lobby}\par
  Other users join the lobby by entering the code or choosing from the public lobbys.
  \item \textbf{Gameplay}\par
  Each player receive one card and than the game starts (The first player is chosen randomically). The game proceeds as described in the rules. when the player want to rise the stakes, he can choose from the possible combinations (non valid combinations will be disabled), if the combination needs some specific card to be declared, the player will be provided with a list of possible cards to choose from.
  \item \textbf{Elimination}\par
  When a player loses, they are eliminated from the game and they can chose to spectate the game or leave the lobby.
  \item \textbf{End of the game}\par
  When the game ends the winner is declared and players who are still in the lobby will be asked wether they want to play another game or leave the lobby.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{comment}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The requirements must explain \textbf{what} (not how) the software
  being produced should do.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item you should not focus on the particular problems, but exclusively on
    what you want the application to do.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Requirements must be clearly identified, and possibly numbered
  \item Requirements are divided into:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Functional}: some functionality the software should provide
    to the user
    \item \textbf{Non-functional}: requirements that do not directly concern
    behavioural aspects, such as consistency, availability, etc.
    \item \textbf{Implementation}: constrain the entire phase of system
    realization, for instance by requiring the use of a specific
    programming language and/or a specific software tool

    \begin{itemize}
      \item these constraints should be adequately justified by political /
      economic / administrative reasons\ldots{}
      \item \ldots{} otherwise, implementation choices should emerge \emph{as
      a consequence of} design
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item If there are domain-specific terms, these should be explained in a
  glossary
  \item Each requirement must have its own \textbf{acceptance criteria}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item these will be important for the validation phase
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{comment}

\section{Design}\label{design}

This chapter explains the strategies used to meet the requirements
identified in the analysis. Ideally, the design should be the same,
regardless of the technological choices made during the implementation
phase.

\begin{quote}
You can re-order the sections as you prefer, but all the sections must
be present in the end
\end{quote}

\subsection{Architecture}\label{architecture}

  The architecture of the system is a classic MVC where:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Model are the classes that represents players and cards
    \item View is UI realized with Web components
    \item Controller is the class that manages the game logic
  \end{itemize}
  For the communication architecture and the distributed part, we opted for a client-server architecture using also a publish-subscribe pattern. \newline
  The idea is that the broker manages the communication between the clients and the server, and the server manages the game logic.\newline
  The server is the one that creates the game; then the clients can join the game publishing their nickname to the broker; every time a new player joins the game, it automatically subscribe to the game topics.\newline
  All the clients are subscribed to the same topic, so they can receive the messages from the server (eg. moves, game status, etc.).\newline

  We choose this architecture because it is simple and it is suitable for our project. In fact, using a publish-subscribe architecture, clients have not to request the server for the game status, but they receive it automatically when the server publishes it (and so on for the other messages).

\subsection{Infrastructure}\label{infrastructure}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item both players and server are components of the pub-sub model
    \item there is one server that manages the game logic so is the only one who can publish messages on some specific topics
    \item there is a broker that manages the communication between the clients and the server
    \item data aren't store permanently, so there is no need for a database 
    \item there aren't authentication mechanisms so every one who knows the broker address can join the game

  \end{itemize}
  Components are distributed over all the network, so they can be on different machines and different networks. For semplicity, we used the same network for all the components and the same machine both for server and broker. \newline
  To find each other, the components use the broker address and the topics to which they have to subscribe or publish; so clients are only required to know the broker address to join the game. \newline
  Components are named using a nickname (unique) that every body choose when they join the game.


\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Architecture diagram}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/pubsubdiagram.png}
  \end{figure}

  Dotted lines are for subscribe messages, while solid lines are for publish messages. \newline

\subsection{Modelling}\label{modelling}
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item which \textbf{domain entities} are there?

%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item e.g.~\emph{users}, \emph{products}, \emph{orders}, \emph{etc.}
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item how do \emph{domain entities} \textbf{map to} \emph{infrastructural
%   components}?

%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item e.g.~state of a video game on central server, while
%     inputs/representations on clients
%     \item e.g.~where to store messages in an IM app? for how long?
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item which \textbf{domain events} are there?

%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item e.g.~\emph{user registered}, \emph{product added to cart},
%     \emph{order placed}, \emph{etc.}
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item which sorts of \textbf{messages} are exchanged?

%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item e.g.~\emph{commands}, \emph{events}, \emph{queries}, \emph{etc.}
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item what information does the \textbf{state} of the system comprehend

%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item e.g.~\emph{users' data}, \emph{products' data}, \emph{orders' data},
%     \emph{etc.}
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% \begin{quote}
% Class diagram are welcome here
% \end{quote}
The system is fundamentally composed by the classes shown in \cref{fig:classes}. \newline
Each component models the real world entities that are needed to play the game:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Players join and create matches, having each one of them has a nickname and a list of cards.
  \item The lobbies are the places where the players can join for a match, 
  waiting for there to be enough people.
  \item The games have a set of players and a deck of playing cards. 
  Each game has a start, where the cards are shuffled and given to players, 
  a playing time when players are given turns to play, and an end when a winner is found.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/classes.png}
  \caption{Class diagram of the system} 
  \label{fig:classes}
\end{figure}

At the core of the entire system are messages, these, given the simple nature of the game, are quite 
simple: containing a single string that represents the move the player wants to make. \newline
The real difference and context of the message is given by the topic to which it is published: 
ff a name is passed to the "player" topic it will be interpreted as the player's nickname,
if it is passed to the "game" topic it will be interpreted as the player's move. \newline
Most notably these are the main topics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{player} \par
  The topic where the players publish their nickname to join the game.
  \item \textbf{game} \par
  The topic where the players publish their moves and the server the game status. \newline
  The name of the topic varies depending on the lobby the player is in.
  \item \textbf{lobby} \par
  The topic where the players create and join lobbies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interaction}\label{interaction}

Components communicate over the network using the MQTT protocol so using a Message Broker pattern. Using this pattern, publishers can send messages without knowing who is going to receive them, and subscribers can receive messages without knowing who is going to send them. 
The broker is the one who manages the communication between the clients and the server, so the clients don't have to know the server address, but only the broker address; on the other hand, the server has to know the broker address to publish messages, but it doesn't have to know the clients' addresses. \newline
This kind of architecture is highly decoupled, so the components can be easily replaced or modified without affecting the others. \newline
The following subsections will explain the interaction between the components in more detail.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Behaviour}\label{behaviour}
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item how does \emph{each} component \textbf{behave} individually (e.g.~in
%   \emph{response} to \emph{events} or messages)?

%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item some components may be \emph{stateful}, others \emph{stateless}
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item which components are in charge of updating the \textbf{state} of the
%   system? \emph{when}? \emph{how}?
% \end{itemize}

% \begin{quote}
% State diagrams are welcome here
% \end{quote}
Even if for the game to be played are only needed players and a centralized logic,
more actors are needed to keep the game going and to manage the communication between them. \newline
The following are all the components actually needed and their behaviours:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  \textbf{The client} \cref{fig:clientStates} \par
  The client first asks the player for their name and the tries to connect him to the broker. 
  If the connection is successful, the client can choose to join a lobby or create a new one. \newline
  When the game starts, the client waits for the server to publish the game status and then it can start playing.
  The client can only send messages to the server when it is his turn, either rising the stakes 
  or calling bullsh*t. If they player lost the match can only wait for it to finish.
  The player leaves the lobby only when a winner is found or loses the game. When the game ends the
  player can rejoin the same lobby and wait for a new game to start or look for a new one. \newline
  At any point during the connection the player can leave or be disconnected, if the player wants to rejoin
  the system will try to put him back in a lobby if they where in one.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/clientStates.png}
    \caption{State diagram of the client} 
    \label{fig:clientStates}
  \end{figure}
  \item
  \textbf{The server} \cref{fig:serverStates} \par
  The server is mainly in charge of connecting new players and creating lobbies, 
  delegating the game logic to an agent. \newline
  At any point in time a new player can ask to connect or disconnect himself, causing the need to
  check wether the player was alone in a lobby, deleting it if left empty. The players connected 
  can also ask to create or join a new lobby and, in case it's full or closed by a player, 
  it will launch a new game istance.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/serverStates.png}
    \caption{State diagram of the server} 
    \label{fig:serverStates}
  \end{figure}
  \item
  \textbf{The broker} \cref{fig:brokerStates} \par
  The broker is the central core to all communications between all the components.
  Always active and using the MQTT standard.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/brokerStates.png}
    \caption{State diagram of the broker} 
    \label{fig:brokerStates}
  \end{figure}
  \item 
  \textbf{The game agent} \cref{fig:gameAgentStates} \par
  The game agent is an istance of the server that takes on the role of managing the single matches.
  It is in charge of managing the game state, the players' moves and the game logic. \newline
  It also preoccupies itself to reconnect the players and resume the game where it left off 
  in case of disconnection. Only checking each connection every time it's the player's turn to
  save some resources.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/gameAgentStates.png}
    \caption{State diagram of the game agent} 
    \label{fig:gameAgentStates}
  \end{figure}
  \item 
  \textbf{The backup} \cref{fig:backupStates} \par
  The backup has to keep a record of every message sent by the broker, keeping a copy of server state. \newline
  This way if the server or the broker fails it can launch a new istance of whichever failed and resume 
  the service. This is a mechanism of fault tolerance that will be discussed later.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/backupStates.png}
    \caption{State diagram of the backup} 
    \label{fig:backupStates}
  \end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data and Consistency
Issues}\label{data-and-consistency-issues}

Since we don't need to store data permanently because this is a card game, we don't deal with queries and databases. \newline
Some datas are shared between components, for example the game status, the players' nicknames, and other crucial information to perform the game. \newline

\subsection{Fault-Tolerance}\label{fault-tolerance}
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Is there any form of data \textbf{replication} / federation / sharing?

%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item \emph{why}? \emph{how} does it work?
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item Is there any \textbf{heart-beating}, \textbf{timeout}, \textbf{retry
%   mechanism}?

%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item \emph{why}? \emph{among} which components? \emph{how} does it work?
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item Is there any form of \textbf{error handling}?

%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item \emph{what} happens when a component fails? \emph{why}? \emph{how}?
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}
Different types of fault tolerance are implemented in the systems, everything is set up to keep
the game running even if some components fail. \newline
The mechanics differ in their scope and purpose:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  \textbf{Server-Side} \par
  The server and the broker are at the core of the game, if they fail the game is lost. \newline
  To prevent this from happening, they are costantly monitored (about once per minute) by a backup
  server. The whole porpouse of the backup is to keep a copy of the game state and to be able to
  resume the game where it left off, in case of failure it launches a new istance of 
  whichever failed, setting it up with the saved data.
  \item
  \textbf{Network-Side} \par
  To make sure that no accidental disconnection can ruin the game, the game agent checks the connection
  of each player every time it's their turn. If a player is disconnected, the game agent will wait for
  them to reconnect, if they don't in a certain time frame they will be kicked from the game. \newline
  Furthermore, the client always has the opportunity to try to reconnect, picking where it left
  off, if anything goes wrong.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Availability}\label{availability}
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Is there any \textbf{caching} mechanism?

%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item \emph{where}? \emph{why}?
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item Is there any form of \textbf{load balancing}?

%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item \emph{where}? \emph{why}?
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item In case of \textbf{network partitioning}, how does the system behave?

%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item \emph{why}? \emph{how}?
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}
At this time we don't really have an availability mechanism. \newline
The only type of caching we have is the broker that keeps the last message sent in a topic
and the backup server that keeps a copy of the game state in case of failure.

\subsection{Security}\label{security}

There aren't any security mechanisms in our project. \newline

\subsection{Technological details}\label{technological-details}

\begin{itemize}
  \item any particular \emph{framework} / \emph{technology} being exploited
  goes here
\end{itemize}

\section{Validation}\label{validation}

\subsection{Automatic Testing}\label{automatic-testing}

\begin{itemize}
  \item how were individual components \textbf{\emph{unit}-test}ed?
  \item how was communication, interaction, and/or integration among
  components tested?
  \item how to \textbf{\emph{end-to-end}-test} the system?

  \begin{itemize}
    \item e.g.~production vs.~test environment
  \end{itemize}
  \item for each test specify:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item rationale of individual tests
    \item how were the test automated
    \item how to run them
    \item which requirement they are testing, if any
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
recall that \emph{deployment} \textbf{automation} is commonly used to
\emph{test} the system in \emph{production-like} environment
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
recall to test corner cases (crashes, errors, etc.)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Acceptance test}\label{acceptance-test}

\begin{itemize}
  \item did you perform any \emph{manual} testing?

  \begin{itemize}
    \item what did you test?
    \item why wasn't it automatic?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Release}\label{release}

\begin{itemize}
  \item how where components organized into \emph{inter-dependant modules} or
  just a single monolith?

  \begin{itemize}
    \item provide a \emph{dependency graph} if possible
  \end{itemize}
  \item were modules distributed as a \emph{single archive} or \emph{multiple
  ones}?

  \begin{itemize}
    \item why?
  \end{itemize}
  \item how were archive versioned?
  \item were archive \emph{released} onto some archive repository (e.g.~Maven,
  PyPI, npm, etc.)?

  \begin{itemize}
    \item how to \emph{install} them?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Deployment}\label{deployment}

\begin{itemize}
  \item should one install your software from scratch, how to do it?

  \begin{itemize}
    \item provide instructions
    \item provide expected outcomes
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{User Guide}\label{user-guide}

\begin{itemize}
  \item how to use your software?

  \begin{itemize}
    \item provide instructions
    \item provide expected outcomes
    \item provide screenshots if possible
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Self-evaluation}\label{self-evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item An individual section is required for each member of the group
  \item Each member must self-evaluate their work, listing the strengths and
  weaknesses of the product
  \item Each member must describe their role within the group as objectively
